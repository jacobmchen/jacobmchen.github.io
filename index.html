                <p>I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns 
                    Hopkins University where I am advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ilyas/">Ilya Shpitser</a>. 
                    My research interests are in developing statistical and machine learning methods for causal inference: 
                    the study of deducing causal quantities from observational data. 
                    I am also interested in the applications of causal inference in healthcare, particularly electronic
                    health records (EHR) data, and the social sciences.

                    <br>
                    I graduated from <a href="https://williams.edu">Williams College</a> in December 2023, receiving a 
                    B.A. with Honors in Computer Science and a concentration/minor in French and Francophone studies. 
                    I wrote my undergraduate thesis with Professor <a href="https://rohit-bhattacharya.com">Rohit Bhattacharya</a>
                    on recovering causal effects under the possibility of confounding bias and self-censoring missing data. My thesis 
                    may be accessed <a href="jacobmchen_williams_thesis.pdf">here</a>.
